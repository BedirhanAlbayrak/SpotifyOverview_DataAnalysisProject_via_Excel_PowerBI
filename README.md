# SpotifyOverview_DataAnalysisProject_via_Excel_PowerBI
# Business Request
As a data analyst who loves to listen to music by using Spotify App, I wanted to show an overview of Spotify’s Data as a Dashboard.
I used the Spotify_1Millon_Tracks dataset which was extracted from the Spotify platform using the Python library “Spotify”, which allows users to access music data provide via APIs.
I took this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/ which provides a lot of datasets to analyze. 
This dataset consists of about 1 million tracks from 2000 to 2023 and sort of details which are artist, song name, duration, popularity, released year, etc.

# Data Cleansing & Transformation (Excel)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis tables were extracted by using Excel.

# Spotify Overview Dashboard (Power BI)
At the final of this project, I created one paged dashboard "Spotify Overview" which shows the key points of Spotify.
